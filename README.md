# Only Goby

Goby syntax highlighting package for Sublime Text 3.

This package is a stripped down, trivial clone of [Better Ruby](https://github.com/fnando/better-ruby-for-sublime-text), cloned with the intention of having such functionality ready in a few minutes :-)

## Install

Clone the repository into the ST Packages folder:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:saveriomiroddi/only-goby-for-sublime-text "$HOME/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/only-goby-for-sublime-text"
```
